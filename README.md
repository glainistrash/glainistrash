### Introduction
 
Greetings! My name is Glain! I'm a Vietnamese Artist who has been drawing for almost a decade.

Glain occasionally speaks in 3rd person as a habit so do be aware!

Remember to read my pony's name before chatting first but he's available most of the tume so don't feel shy to chat ^^!

I usually hang out around the PHIGHTING! area using Umbrella (my P! OC), Boombox, Rainbox or my P!Sona ponies (Claws)! I have others too! :D

I also hang out in the G&B area (which is below the P! area) using Silas or Harvey (Both OCs)!

**Main Brainrotting: Guts & Blackpowder, PHIGHTING! and Regretevator!!**
