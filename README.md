### Introduction
 
Greetings! My name is Glain! I'm a Vietnamese Artist who has been drawing for almost a decade.

Glain occasionally speaks in 3rd person as a habit so do be aware!

Remember to read my pony's name before chatting first but he's available most of the time so don't feel shy to chat ^^!

I sometimes hang out around the PHIGHTING! area using [Umbrella](https://file.garden/ZogMxQjYh2LIAH4W/pony-town-Umbrella-%20P!%20OC%20-%20INT_W2I_C%2BH-stand-shadow-name-bg-padded-16x.png) (my P! OC), [Boombox](https://file.garden/ZogMxQjYh2LIAH4W/pony-town-Boombox%20-%20P!%20-%20INT_C%2BH-stand-shadow-name-bg-padded-16x%20(1).png), [Rainbox](https://file.garden/ZogMxQjYh2LIAH4W/pony-town-Rainbox%20-%20P!%20-%20INT_C%2BH-stand-shadow-name-bg-padded-16x.png) or [Claws](https://file.garden/ZogMxQjYh2LIAH4W/pony-town-Claws-P!Sona-INT_C%2BH_IC-stand-shadow-name-bg-padded-16x.png) (My P!Sona)! I have others too! :D

I usually hang out in the G&B area (which is below the P! area) using [Silas](https://file.garden/ZogMxQjYh2LIAH4W/pony-town-_i'm%20blind_-G%26B%20OC-INT_C%2BH-stand-name-bg-padded-16x.png), [Harvey](https://file.garden/ZogMxQjYh2LIAH4W/pony-town-_hey%20Big%20Si!_-G%26B%20OC-INT_C%2BH-stand-name-bg-padded-16x.png) or [Millard](https://file.garden/ZogMxQjYh2LIAH4W/pony-town-Millard%20Gordon%20Gilbert-G%26B%20OC-stand-name-bg-padded-toy346-16x.png) (All OCs)!

I'm more active in the G&B area so please interact with me there!! ^_^

In the same area, you may find me in these (I recently got dragged into 2 new fandoms, help)!: [DvN cosplay](https://file.garden/ZogMxQjYh2LIAH4W/pony-town-_speechless_-DvN%20cos-INT_C%2BH-stand-name-bg-padded-16x.png), [Faker](https://file.garden/ZogMxQjYh2LIAH4W/pony-town-Faker-DvN%20OC-INT_IC-stand-name-bg-padded-16x.png) (DvN OC), [Umbrella](https://file.garden/ZogMxQjYh2LIAH4W/pony-town-_when%20i%20see%20you%20cry_-DD%20OC-INT-stand-name-bg-padded-16x.png) (DD OC) amd [Vest](https://file.garden/ZogMxQjYh2LIAH4W/pony-town-_it%20makes%20me%20smile_-DD%20OC-INT-stand-name-bg-padded-16x.png) (DD OC)

### DO NOT INTERACT

- Proshippers, pedophiles, groomers, etc...
- Homophobes, Transphobes, etc...
- Basic DNI
+ More might be added in the future.

-------------------------------------

### INTERACT WITH CAUTION

- DID/OSDD (I did not have good experience with them for the past couple of days. Pony Town has become slowly toxic so it increased the amount of people to fake their mental illness). The sole expectation to this is my partners.
- Dandy's World ‚Äúfans‚Äù (The fandom is the reason. But I like the game, it's adorable in some ways.)
+ More might be added in the future.
